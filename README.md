## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome, as long as the tests pass.

Feedback to both this library and this guide is welcome.

### Running the tests

Differ is assumed to work with Clojure 1.6, and Clojurescript 2371.

There is a leiningen alias that makes it easy to run the tests against supported Clojure versions:

```bash
λ lein all-tests
```
